Problem: Given two sets of elements, find the sum of all distinct elements from the set. In other words, find the sum of all elements which are present in either of the given set.
Example:
Set 1 : [3, 1, 7, 9], Set 2: [2, 4, 1, 9, 3]
Output: 13 (distinct elements 4, 7, 2 )
Give a solutions to this problem, using arrays

Solution:
Create a variable for the first set and the second set 
Create a variable that holds the sum
Read the first set and check if any of the first set is not present in the second set
If true add the element to sum
Read the second set and check if element in the second set is not in set 1
if true add the element to sum
